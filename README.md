# `make_ge_version_regexp.sh`

A fork of [William Smith's `Match Version Number or Higher.bash`](https://gist.github.com/talkingmoose/2cf20236e665fcd7ec41311d50c89c0e).

I'm hoping these changes get incorporated into William's script so that I don't
have to maintain this fork.

Feedback is welcome!

## Improvements

- Simplified patterns with 14-25% reduction in character length.
- Unit tests
- CLI options
- No spaces in the script name.

*Improvements compared to May 24, 2020 version of William's script.*

## Usage

```
USAGE:
        ./make_ge_version_regex.sh [OPTIONS] VERSION

OPTIONS:
        -h: show help
        -n: not using jamf
        -s: silent mode
```

Example usage:

```
$ ./make_ge_version_regex.sh -sn 1.0.0

Regex for "1.0.0" or higher (65 characters):

^(\d{2}|[2-9]|1\.\d{2}|1\.[1-9]|1\.0\.\d{2}|1\.0\.[1-9]|1\.0\.0)

```

## Unit Tests

Requires [`bash_unit`](https://github.com/pgrange/bash_unit).

```
bash_unit tests.sh
```

## Explanation of Regular Expression Changes

Take a simple pattern generated with [the original script](https://github.com/moorereason/make_ge_version_regex/blob/fc6a574e35caeb6fd3f97581a48d5832080a1f3d/make_ge_version_regex.sh):

```
$ ./make_ge_version_regexp.sh 7
...
Regex for "7" or higher (25 characters):

^(\d{2,}.*|[8-9].*|7.*)$
```

Compare that pattern to what's generated by the modified script in this
repository:

```
$ ./make_ge_version_regexp.sh 7
...
Regex for "7" or higher (16 characters):

^(\d{2}|[89]|7)
```

Let's look at each change individually...

#### Reducing `\d{2,}` to `\d{2}`

At this stage of the logic, we know we have a single digit, `7`.  Since we're
looking for any version greater than or equal to 7, we know that any number with
two or more digits will be greater than the string `7`; however, we don't care
that there are three or more digits.  We know that just two digits meets the
requirement, so we remove the `,` from the quantifier to save one character in
the pattern length for each numbered segment in the version string.

#### Removing `.*` and `$`

The `.*` is superfluous for our needs.  By the time we get to the `.*` token
sequence in the pattern, we already know that we've matched the important bits
or not.  For each member of the pattern grouping, we can save two characters in
the pattern length by removing this token sequence.

Additionally, removing the `.*` token sequence necessitates removing the
trailing `$` token which saves one character per pattern.

#### Reducing `[8-9]` to `[89]`

Since `[8-9]` and `[89]` are equivalent, we can save a single character for each
`7` in the version string.

#### Comparing a Complex Version String

Given `7.4.59931.0110`, compare the before and after to see these changes play
out in the generated patterns:

```
^(\d{2,}.*|[8-9].*|7\.\d{2,}.*|7\.[5-9].*|7\.4\.\d{6,}.*|7\.4\.[6-9]\d{4,}.*|7\.4\.599[4-9]\d{1,}.*|7\.4\.5993[2-9].*|7\.4\.59931\.\d{5,}.*|7\.4\.59931\.[1-9]\d{3,}.*|7\.4\.59931\.0[2-9]\d{2,}.*|7\.4\.59931\.01[2-9]\d{1,}.*|7\.4\.59931\.011[1-9].*|7\.4\.59931\.0110.*)$
^(\d{2}|[89]|7\.\d{2}|7\.[5-9]|7\.4\.\d{6}|7\.4\.[6-9]\d{4}|7\.4\.599[4-9]\d{1}|7\.4\.5993[2-9]|7\.4\.59931\.\d{5}|7\.4\.59931\.[1-9]\d{3}|7\.4\.59931\.0[2-9]\d{2}|7\.4\.59931\.01[2-9]\d{1}|7\.4\.59931\.011[1-9]|7\.4\.59931\.0110)
```
